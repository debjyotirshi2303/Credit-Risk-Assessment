# Credit Risk Assessment

This is a brief guide on how to set up and run this project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- pip (Python Package Installer)

## Steps to Setup and Run

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated environments for them.

To create a virtual environment, navigate to the directory where you want to create your environment and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

This will create a new directory named `myenv` in your current directory. This is your new virtual environment.

### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment

After you've created a virtual environment, you'll need to activate it.

If you're using Windows, you can do this by running the following command in cmd.exe:

```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd path_of_project_directory
```

Replace `path_of_project_directory` with the actual path to your project directory.

### Step 4: Install Required Dependencies

This project comes with a `requirements.txt` file, which contains a list of all the Python dependencies needed to run the project.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Run the Application

The project can be run using Streamlit. If you've installed all the dependencies correctly, you can start the project by running the following command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will start the server, and you can navigate to the URL provided in the console to view the application.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems during setup or running of the project, please check that you've correctly followed all the steps above. 
If you're still experiencing problems, feel free to reach out or open an issue.
